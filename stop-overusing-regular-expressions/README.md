# Franklin Chen: *Stop overusing regular expressions!*

This is an information page about the presentation at [Pittsburgh Tech Fest 2013](http://www.pghtechfest.com/), given on June 1, 2013.

## Abstract of talk

Regular expressions are very commonly used to process and validate text data. Unfortunately, they suffer from various limitations. I will discuss the limitations and illustrate how using grammars instead can be an improvement. I will make the examples concrete using parsing libraries in a couple of representative languages, although the ideas are language-independent. (I'll try to squeeze in, say, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Scala.)

I will emphasize ease of use, since one reason for the overuse of regular expressions is that they are so easy to pull out of one's toolbox.
