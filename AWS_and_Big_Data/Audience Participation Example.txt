"Secret" goal: add 100 numbers

1.) I'm "JobTracker", volunteer is "HDFS"

2.) 10 Volunteers ("TaskTracker/DataNodes"), each gets a block of data (piece of paper with 10 of 100 numbers)

3.) JobTracker gets new job

4.) JobTracker hands out sealed paper ("Map task") to volunteers

5.) Map task for most: If asked how going, either say "ok" or "done".  Task: add your numbers together.  When done, write down answer and give it to Dan ("HDFS").  When done, Dan gives partial results to single person (for simplicity)

6.) I ask 10 volunteers over and over "how's it going"?

7.) 8 volunteers work, two volunteers get instructions to 
 a.) not respond (dead/disconnected node)
 b.) pretend to answer their phone (busy node)

8.) After 3 failures in 7, give Map task to other volunteers (mention speculative execution)

9.) When 10 successes, give out sealed paper to person with all partial results ("Reduce task")

10.) They also sum 10 numbers, and give final answer
