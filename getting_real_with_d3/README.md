# Getting Real with D3

There is no shortage of data visualization libraries. D3 however takes a refreshing new approach to visualizing data. It concerns itself less with plotting or drawing and focuses more on the core of data visualization â€“ the data.

This talk will introduce the D3 way of data visualization thinking and discuss how Node.js fits into the mix to make compelling real time visualizations. The presentation will use several demos including a real time interactive demo with audience participation.
