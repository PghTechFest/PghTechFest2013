# Constantine Aaron Cois: Node.js Patterns for Discerning Developers

## Description

Node.js brings JavaScript to the server-side. The up-side of this is an excellent event-based backend framework capable of lightning fast real-time interactions. The down-side is the baggage: the bulk of bad coding habits and antipatterns left over from frontend JavaScript that silently creep their way into Node.js codebases. Think plague-infected ninjas. In addition, the asynchronous nature of file and network I/O inherent to Node.js can cause its own array of headaches. 

Discerning developers want more. 

In this session, I’ll fight the good fight by presenting some high-quality design patterns for Node.js applications. I’ll bring to the table design patterns I’ve stumbled across in my own Node projects, as well as patterns observed from the classiest members of the Node community. Examples include:

* Defining your models with ORMs such as Mongoose
* Using Async.js to avoid callback hell
* The batch pattern for asynchronous concurrent file I/O
* ...and much more!

Top hat and monocle encouraged, but not required.
