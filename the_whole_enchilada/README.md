## The Whole Enchilada <br /> Inception to delivery in just 2 weeks

This is a talk about delivering an application from the top-level inception all the way to publishing to the app store, with stops to talk about the people and the code along the way.

## Abstract of talk

 * Agility & Collaboration
 * Test Driven Development
 * Tools of the trade
 * Delivery / Open Source

We could have built a simple "hello world app" to demonstrate how we do things. That would be lame. Instead, we decided to find a local customer and demonstrate on a small scale how we rock out apps @LeanDog We will take you through the entire process from the initial planning, to testing, building, and deploying a native Android application for our local lunch favorite - Ohio City Burrito.
