<h3>Services</h3>

<p>Services in Angular represent injectable dependencies you can use in controllers, directives and filters. Generally,
    these dependencies are created to abstract away things like Ajax calls, but they can also be used to abstract away
    calls to the DOM or even other JavaScript libraries, such as the Facebook JS API.</p>
