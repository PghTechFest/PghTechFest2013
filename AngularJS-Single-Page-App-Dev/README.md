#AngularJS - Single Page Application Development

This is a site written entirely with JavaScript for the purpose of doing a presentation on AngularJS to the good people at the Pittsburgh TechFest 2013.

## Getting Started
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) is required to run the RESTful api used in the "Todos Example".

You can download NodeJS from [here](http://nodejs.org)

After that, you would just go into your command prompt, and run the "app.js" file from the root directory with node, like so:

    $ node app.js

Then you can browse to http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

The todos example "RESTful" end point is at http://localhost:3000/todos

###Apologies... 

The node_modules folder is quite large (9MB), but I wanted to include everything required to run the server.  Most of the *important* stuff is in the /public/javascripts/app directory or in /public/examples
